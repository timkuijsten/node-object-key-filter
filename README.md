# object-key-filter

Filter certain keys from an object without side-effects, optionally recurse.

## Example

Remove the key `baz` from an object:
```js
const assert = require('assert');
const filter = require('object-key-filter');

const obj = {
  foo: 'bar',
  baz: { foo: 'quz' }
};

const obj2 = filter(obj, ['baz']);
assert.deepEqual(obj2, { foo: 'bar' });
```

Remove the key `foo` recursively:
```js
const obj3 = filter(obj, ['foo'], true);
assert.deepEqual(obj3, { baz: {} });
```

## Installation

    $ npm install object-key-filter
